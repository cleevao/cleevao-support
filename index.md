## 2. What Information We Collect and Why

We collect a limited amount of information for specific purposes related to the educational function of our app.

#### A. Account Information

- **What we collect**: A username and an avatar you select from our list. To enable account recovery, we also generate and store a secure recovery code.
- **Why we collect it**: To create and maintain your anonymous account, save your progress, and allow you to recover your account if you change devices.

#### B. Educational Progress

- **What we collect**: Your scores on exercises.
- **Why we collect it**: To save your progress in the app so you can continue your learning journey and track your achievements.

#### C. Subscription Information

- **Age Verification**: We require an adult (e.g., a parent or guardian) to complete a neutral age-gate before a subscription can be purchased.
- **What we collect**: When a subscription is purchased, Apple provides us with a purchase receipt that includes a transaction ID and the subscription's status and expiration date.
- **Why we collect it**: To verify your purchase and unlock premium features in the app. We do **not** collect or store any payment information like credit card numbers; this is all handled securely by Apple.


## 3. How We Share Information

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share data with the following essential service providers:

- **Supabase**: We use Supabase for our backend database and authentication. Your account information and educational progress are stored securely with them. Users can only access their own data.
- **Apple**: We use Apple's In-App Purchase system to process and manage subscriptions.

We will not share data with any third-party advertising or data analytics companies.


## 4. Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously.

- All communication between the app and our servers is protected with industry-standard HTTPS encryption.
- We use Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) features, which ensure that a user can only ever access their own data.


## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your account information and educational progress as long as your account is active.

You have the right to delete your account at any time from the Profile page within the app. When you delete your account, we will permanently delete your user profile and all associated data from our servers.
